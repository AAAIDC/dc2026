bio: "Katerina Fragkiadaki is the JPMorgan Chase Associate Professor in the Machine
Learning Department in Carnegie Mellon University. She received her undergraduate diploma from Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens. 
She received her Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania and was a postdoctoral fellow in
UC Berkeley and Google research after that.  Her work focuses on combining
forms of common sense reasoning, such as spatial understanding and 3D scene understanding, with deep visuomotor learning.  The goal of her work is to enable few-shot learning and continual learning for perception, action and language grounding.  Her  group develops methods for computer vision for mobile agents, 2D and 3D visual parsing, 2D-to-3D perception,  vision-language grounding,  learning of object dynamics, navigation and manipulation policies. Pioneering innovations of her group’s research include 2D-to-3D geometry-aware neural networks for 3D understanding from 2D video streams,   analogy-forming networks for memory-augmented few-shot visual parsing, and language-grounding in 2D and 3D scenes with bottom-up and top-down attention.  Her work has been awarded with a best Ph.D. thesis award,  an NSF CAREER award, AFOSR Young Investigator award, a DARPA Young Investigator award, Google, TRI, Amazon, UPMC and Sony faculty research awards. She is a program chair for ICLR 2024.
