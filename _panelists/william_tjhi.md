bio: "William Tjhi has been practising machine learning and data science in Singapore for more than a decade. He got his PhD from Nanyang Technological University in 2008, with a thesis focusing on unsupervised learning. Since then, he has been exploring the various landscapes where statistical learning is used; from research labs, the commercial and public sectors, to tech startups. From these diverse experiences, he has gained a significant appreciation of the different perspectives about the technology across the ecosystem. Today, William remains a keen learner of the fundamentals of this very dynamic discipline. At the same time, he is also intrigued by the complexity of translating them into actual values in the messy world of the industry. He is now a Head of AI at AI Singapore, a national programme office based in National University of Singapore. His current interests include Natural Language Processing, the regional practice of AI and the fascinating intersection between the two."
